Usage Guide - Generating Projects
====================================

You've been directed here because the project you're viewing uses Protobuild to
generate it's projects.

If you are on Windows, you can quickly generating projects for the default
platforms by double-clicking on the Protobuild executable in the root of 
the repository.

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, you'll need to open a terminal, and once
in the root of project repository, run:

    $ mono Protobuild.exe --generate

You'll need Mono installed if you are on Mac OS X or Linux.
    
If you want to use Protobuild for your own projects, and potentially use this
project as a submodule, refer to the :ref:`user-docs`.
