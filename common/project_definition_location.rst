Project definition location
-----------------------------

All project definitions for your module should be placed under the 
``Build\Module`` directory and have a ``.definition`` extension.  The name of
the project should match the name of the file as well; for a project called
"MyProject", the project definition should reside at 
``Build\Module\MyProject.definition``.

.. tip::
    This is the location for all project definitions, including application,
    console, library, content, include and external projects.
